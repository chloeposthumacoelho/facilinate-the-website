## The Goals
I wanted to create a webpage for my app, Facilinate. The main goal of facilinate is to address the lack of visibility donation centers may have, which is is an issue which affect both centers needing donations, and potential donors themselves.

## Why facilinate?
a deterrent to donating can be lack of advertised opportunities nearby. When looking at the case of college students, donation centers located within or nearby college towns or campuses can and should be an opportunity for collaboration and visibility between potential donors (students, faculty, staff) and centers especially in crucial times where donation centers could benefit, such as college move out weeks, where students are clearing out shelves and discarding unwanted items, yet many may not know how and where to donate their things. Simply put, Facilinate aims to provide students greater motivation to donate.

## How facilinate was built
1. The prototype was built in visual studio code w/ HTML, SCSS, and jQuery. (see the process at: https://www.behance.net/gallery/144848891/facilinate-a-better-more-personalized-way-to-donate)
2. Actual app (at https://chloeposthumacoelho.github.io/Facilinate/)
The prototype was developed using figma. I then used HTML/SCSS for front-end purposes, as well as React.js/Babel/jQuery , Procreate and canva for the design assets, and Firebase for functionality testing.


## the facilinate website

Here is the facilinate website, which has the goal of bringing further visibility to my app:

## The Positives
The creation of a more appealing and welcoming UI through the selection of a consistent color palette and of designs created to advertise facilinate were positives! 
Furthermore, facilinate provides the goal of and main concept of an app that could provide
readily accessible information about donation centers which takes into account the context of a college student (car accessibility and transport, items the student may want to donate.

The functionality of the app has been greatly improved to address its main goal: to motivate busy college students who have cluttered dorms during move out but want to help donate- as well as giving these students the ability to make friends and connections with other fellow peers  with similar interests.

## Features include:

1. ability to filter donation centers by proximity- especially helpful for college town students.
2. ability to choose alters/filter by date or time (weekly, monthly, moving out rush period, etc)
3. chat features with both peers and donation center contacts
4. personalized recommendations based off donation interests of both user and nearby centers (toiletries, warm clothing, etc).
